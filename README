-----------------------------
Leap Motion GNOME Controller
-----------------------------

This is a relatively small Python script that uses Leap Motion's libs to
detect hands' motion and gestures and interprets them, producing a
corresponding action for the GNOME Desktop.


----------
How to Use
----------

Assuming you have all that is needed for the Leap device to be detected
and used...
Run the leapd daemon, then run leap-gnome-controller.py:
$ leapd &
$ ./leap-gnome-controller.py


--------
Gestures
--------

Use one hand with one finger sticking out in order to control the mouse.
If the mouse doesn't move too much for a little while, it will be stopped
until a there is a big move again. This makes it easier to perform a click.
